Human Pose Estimation Based Robust Gait Generation and Estimation in Humanoid Robot

 In this paper ,we have proposed a methodology to achieve adaptive and autonomous gait generation and correction mechanisms in humanoid robots. 
The methodology used in this paper has been implemented in Robotis Darwin Humanoid Robots for dynamic gait generation in uneven terrain and inclined plane.

The paper follows a two-thread process where the first thread deals with generating the gait pattern and after implementing the generated gait, the second thread has a feedback mechanism for gait correction.

2D Pose Estimation is used on Human Gait videos to extract gait cycle pattern which is normalized and applied to the Robotic actuators.An IMU sensor present in the Centre of the Robot provides the feedback data for This paper proposes a detailed methodology and observations of the experimentation conducted.
